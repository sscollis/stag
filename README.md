## Stag

Solves the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes 
equations on a staggered mesh system.

I have updated this version to build on Darwin with gfortran

This code was developed primarily for educational purposes and comes
in several versions that demonstrate different capabilities and levels
of complexity.

Version | Notes
--------|-------------------------------------
  3     | Stable solver	
  4     | Multiple pressure solvers
  5     | REAL defines added to version 3
  6     | Immersed boundary conditions added to 3
